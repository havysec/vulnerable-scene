/**
 * Crée un verrou pour NFS
 *
 * (Excerpts from Chuck's notes:
 *   this becomes complex, due to our dear friend, the NFS mounted mail spool.
 *   the netbsd code didn't do this properly, as far as I could tell.
 *
 *   - you can't trust exclusive creating opens over NFS, the protocol
 *   just doesn't support it.   so to do a lock you have to create
 *   a tmp file and then try and hard link it to your lock file.
 *   - to detect a stale lock file you have to see how old it is, but
 *   you can't use time(0) because that is the time on the local system
 *   and the file gets the times of the NFS server.  when is a lock
 *   file stale?  people seem to like 120 or 300 seconds.)
 *
 * NB: It is _critical_ that nfslock()ed files be unlocked by nfsunlock().
 * Simply unlinking the lock file is a good way to trash someone else's lock
 * file. All it takes is for the process doing the unlink to get hung for
 * a few minutes when it doesn't expect it. Meanwhile, its lock expires and
 * a second process forces the lock and creates its own. Then the first
 * process comes along and kills the second process' lock while it's still
 * valid.
 *
 * Security considerations:
 * If we're root, be very careful to see that the temp file we opened is
 * what we think it is. The problem is that we could lose a race with
 * someone who takes our tmp file and replaces it with, say, a hard
 * link to /etc/passwd. Then, if the first lock attempt fails, we'll
 * write a char to the file (see 4. below); this would truncate the
 * passwd file. So we make sure that the link count is 1. We don't really
 * care about any other screwing around since we don't write anything
 * sensitive to the lock file, nor do we change its owner or mode. If
 * someone beats us on a race and replaces our temp file with anything
 * else, it's no big deal- the file may get truncated, but there's no
 * possible security breach. ...Actually the possibility of the race
 * ever happening, given the random name of the file, is virtually nil.
 *
 * args: path = path to directory of lock file (/net/u/1/a/alexis/.mailspool)
 *       namelock = file name of lock file (alexis.lock)
 *   max_age = age of lockfile, in seconds, after which the lock is stale.
 *    stale locks are always broken. Defaults to DEFAULT_LOCKTIME
 *    if zero. Panix mail locks go stale at 300 seconds, the default.
 *       notify = 1 if we should tell stdout that we're sleeping on a lock
 *
 * Returns the time that the lock was created on the other system. This is
 * important for nfsunlock(). If the lock already exists, returns NFSL_LOCKED.
 * If there is some other failure, return NFSL_SYSF. If NFSL_LOCKED is
 * returned, errno is also set to EEXIST. If we're root and the link count
 * on the tmp file is wrong, return NFSL_SECV.
 *
 * Mods of 7/13/95: Change a bit of code to re-stat the lockfile after
 * closing it. This is to work around a bug in SunOS that appears to to affect
 * some SunOS 4.1.3 machines (but not all). The bug is that close() updates
 * the stat st_ctime field for that file. So use lstat on fullpath instead
 * of fstat on tmpfd. This alteration applies to both nfslock and nfslock1.
 *
 * Mod of 5/4/95: Change printf's to fprintf(stderr... in nfslock and nfslock1.
 *
 * Mods of 4/29/95: Fix freeing memory before use if a stat fails. Remove
 * code that forbids running as root; instead, if root, check link count on
 * tmp file after opening it.
 *
 * Mods of 4/27/95: Return the create time instead of the lockfile's fd, which
 * is useless. Added new routines nfsunlock(), nfslock_test(), nfslock_renew().
 *
 * Mods of 1/8/95: Eliminate some security checks since this code never
 * runs as root. In particular, we completely eliminate the safeopen
 * routine. But add one check: if we _are_ root, fail immediately.
 *
 * Change arguments: take a path and a filename. Don't assume a global or
 * macro pointing to a mailspool.
 *
 * Add notify argument; if 1, tell user when we're waiting for a lock.
 *
 * Add max_age argument and DEFAULT_LOCKTIME.
 *
 * Change comments drastically.

/**
 * Unlock an nfslock()ed file
 *
 * This can get tricky because the lock may have expired (perhaps even
 * during a process that should be "atomic"). We have to make sure we don't
 * unlock some other process' lock, and return a panic code if we think our
 * lock file has been broken illegally. What's done in reaction to that panic
 * (of anything) is up to the caller. See the comments on nfslock()!

 *       namelock = file name of lock file (alexis.lock)
 *       max_age = age of lockfile, in seconds, after which the lock is stale.
 *    stale locks are always broken. Defaults to DEFAULT_LOCKTIME
 *    if zero. Panix mail locks go stale at 300 seconds, the default.
 *   birth = time the lock was created (as returned by nfslock()).
 *
 * Returns NFSL_OK if successful, NFSL_LOST if the lock has been lost
 * legitimately (because more than max_age has passed since the lock was
 * created), and NFSL_STOLEN if it's been tampered with illegally (i.e.
 * while this program is within the expiry period). Returns NFSL_SYSF if
 * another system failure prevents it from even trying to unlock the file.
 *
 * Note that for many programs, a return code of NFSL_LOST or NFSL_STOLEN is
 * equally disastrous; a NFSL_STOLEN means that some other program may have
 * trashed your file, but a NFSL_LOST may mean that _you_ have trashed someone
 * else's file (if in fact you wrote the file that you locked after you lost
 * the lock) or that you read inconsistent information.
 *
 * In practice, a return code of NFSL_LOST or NFSL_STOLEN will virtually never
